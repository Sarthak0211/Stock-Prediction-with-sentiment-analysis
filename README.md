# Stock-Prediction-with-sentiment-analysis

Predicting the performance of the stock market is a very difficult task. A number of factors are involved in the prediction -physical factors vs. psychological, rational and irrational behaviour, etc. All these factors affect the market as they make the share prices volatile and difficult to predict.The various algorithms used for forecasting can be categorized into linear (AR, MA, ARIMA, ARMA) and non-linear models (ARCH, GARCH, Neural Network). In this paper we use two deep learning techniques - Bi-deirection Long Short Term Network (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to predict the stock prices and compare the performance of these models. We also include sentiment analysis to both the models with the help of two NLP toolkits (VADER & FLAIR). We provide the models with historical data regarding the opening price of the stock for training. The model has a look back period of 5 days and predicts the opening price of the 6th day. The TCN as well as the Bi-LSTM model were able to capture the trend in the stock prices.

1) Reddit - In this ipynb, we farmed the subreddit r/technews for articles pertaining to the technology industry. This gave us the sentiment data for our model. We used Flair to then classify the sentiments as positive or negative.
2) Stock market prediction - Here we create the deep learning models that eventually predict the opening price of the stock.
